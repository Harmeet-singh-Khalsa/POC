Meeting Points : 	
 1. category tbale : ID (int/guid), type, name, short-description, long-description, created-date, updated-date, who Updated 
 2. single table with parent id -- complex for search operations
 3. isdeleted field default 0 dtype bool [if you dont want to show some data mark it 1 -- soft delete]
 4. inventory -- store stock details
 5. new version and dont want old version to show
 6. sale going on
 7. cart and user 1 to 1 mapping
